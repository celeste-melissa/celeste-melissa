## Welcome to my profile friend. My name is Celeste. I graduated with a B.S. degree in software development but I love the different facets of technology. My goal is to pursue a masters degree in computer science soon. I am currently learning full-stack development. However, as mentioned earlier my interest does not soley lie in software but in the study of technology 9n general, in saying that, I also have interests in data analysis and cybersecurity. I upload projects, practice assessments, and notes that I deem important. Maybe we can be friends? Happy coding! ðŸ‘‹
